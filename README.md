# Instron 4507 Data Analysis
Matlab code which analyses displacement-load data measured by an Instron 4507. 

This includes tensile testing of typical tensile specimens and crush testing of tubes &amp; honeycomb structures, calculating energy absorption and related metrics.

## Tensile Testing Script

A script for the analysis of tensile testing data. Generates plots for: 

-Engineering stress-strain

-True stress-strain

Calculates: 

-Young's modulus

-Yield strength

-Ultimate tensile strength

-Fracture strain

-Poisson's ratio

## Quasi-Static Testing Script

A script for the analysis of quasi-static crush testing data. Generates plots for: 

-Loading history

-Load vs displacement

-Diameter to wall thickness ratio vs energy absorption efficiency metrics

-Diameter to wall thickness ratio vs energy absorption

-Diameter to wall thickness ratio vs loading 

-Length to diameter ratio vs energy absorption efficiency metrics

-Length to diameter ratio vs energy absorption

-Length to diameter ratio vs loading 

Calculates:

-Maximum and mean loads

-Maximum displacement

-Energy absorbed

-Energy efficiency

-Stroke efficiency

-Crush force efficiency
